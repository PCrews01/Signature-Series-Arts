      "I have a ritual of having a meeting with my team (CANTSTOP) before every show. We basically discuss how every performance is the biggest one yet and to remain humble. I also chug a Monster right before every set.",
      "MGK, Logic, Linkin Park.",
      "Mostly all my uptempo hype songs. Upcoming artist tend to not understand that certain songs arent performance songs. So i pick the most catchy and energetic songs. I also go by the area/crowd im going to be performing in front of.",
      "This is one of the most important things. You dont want to go to early (everybody wont he there) and you dont want to go to late. (people leave) So my favorite is either 3rd or 4th.",
      "Who i am, and that i was the best performance they seen from an up coming artist.",
      "The crowd not being into my set, and literally having conversations with each other while i was performing.",
      "The entire crowd screaming my name and cheering every time a song came on! Mosh pits opening and starting, along with the crowd hand waving on my cue."
